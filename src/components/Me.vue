    <h1>Who am I</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hi everyone, I am Anton de Regt. A few years ago I studied Embedded Systems and Automation which sparked my passion for programming.
      I love to build small apps, ranging from web apps to Android/iOS apps. When I'm not programming I love to read books, currently, I'm reading
      The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution by Walter Isaacson. Also, I try to work out a few times a week,
      I like any team sport. <a href="/social">Contact</a> me whenever you have a question, maybe I can help you solve your problem.
